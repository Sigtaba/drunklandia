            <p class="about-p">
              Drunklandia started as a group project at Epicodus by four aspiring developers who were looking for their next happy hour. However, with the large number of bars in Portland to pick from, it was hard to find one that met all their needs. They wanted to be able to search for local happy hours and filter their results by dietary restrictions, patio seating, and various other categories. Thus, Drunklandia was born. </p>

               I hail from California, where I earned my BA in Communication from Santa Clara University in 2007. After working at Google for several years, I decided to change course, travel to other countries, and move to the Portland, OR area. I live in Vancouver, WA and have spent the last few years working primarily as a lash and makeup artist in the Portland area.  <br>

               My name is Jared Eiseman. I am an aspiring web developer and current student of Epicodus. I live in Vancouver, Washington with my roommate and his cat. On the weekends you would be able to find me either working in a local game store, singing karaoke with friends, or binge watching movies and TV shows with my roommates cat, Boogeyman. After over 15 years of being a hobbyist, only to have my passion for web development grow with every morsel of learning I have decided to take the step of making a career switch into he web development and design industry. I am excited for this new endeavor.<br>

                I was born in Bend, Oregon on June 1st (Gemini!) and have been back and forth between Bend and the Portland area ever since. To this day I haven't figured out which I like more- the country or the city. I am a huge animal lover, but frogs are my all time favorite. Hiking, photography, rainy days, avocados, and scary movies are a few of my favorite things, and I have a not-so-guilty pleasure of binging on terrible reality TV shows (I'm talking the really bad ones). More recently I have started going to Buddhist meditation sessions every weekend, and I try to meditate at least once every day. It is a practice that I have found really helps clear my mind, which has come in at Epicodus where I feel I am stuffing my brain with a ton of information all day!<br>

               I graduated from DePaul University with a BSB in Honors Economics. After college I moved back to St. Louis and worked at various ecommerce positions, ranging from family businesses to more well known companies. After a while I moved out to Portland, Oregon to work as an eCommerce Coordinator at CRKT. There, I coordinated launch and maintenance of the company's website. I realized I was much more interested in designing websites rather than managing them. After about a year of working there I applied to Epicodus where I am now studying CSS and Web Design.<br>
